<!--
a lot of things happening here:
adding conditionals for selecting a css class,
binding click events,
clearing the heroName after calling the add method

the component is responsible for updating the display, so stuff should be moved there
-->

<h2>My Heroes</h2>
<ul class="heroes">
    <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes"
        [class.selected]="hero === selectedHero"
        (click)="onSelect(hero)">
        <span class="badge">{{hero.id}}</span>
        <span>{{hero.name}}</span>
        <!-- stops the propagation of the click event â€”
        we don't want the <li> click handler to be triggered
        because that would select the hero that we are going to delete! -->
        <!-- maybe the stopPropagation should be in the delete method of the component? -->
        <button class="delete"
                (click)="delete(hero); $event.stopPropagation()">x</button>
    </li>
</ul>

<!--
move hero details to its own view
<my-hero-detail [hero]="selectedHero"></my-hero-detail>
-->

<!-- replace it with a minidetail -->
<div *ngIf="selectedHero">
    <h2>
        {{selectedHero.name | uppercase}} is my hero
    </h2>
    <button (click)="gotoDetail()">View Details</button>
</div>

<div>
    <label>Hero name:</label> <input #heroName />
    <!-- maybe the heroName.value='' should be in the component add method -->
    <button (click)="add(heroName.value); heroName.value=''">
        Add
    </button>
</div>
